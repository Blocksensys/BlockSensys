Distributed Ledger Blockchain (DLB) technology is a Disruptive Innovation to the digital identity management services industry. Currently, no standardized format for the storage and transfer of digitally signed credentials exists. A Blockchain Digital Identity Management System (BDIMS) would allow the general population to send official identity documentation securely from home, contact-free. The BDIMS is the application of time-stamping (Haber & Stornetta, 1991), cryptography, and distributed ledger decentralized architecture to the storage and transmission of Personally Identifiable Digital Identity (PIDI) data for official identity documentation management. PIDI data is sensitive and must be encrypted onto each block recorded on the distributed ledger so that it is non-transparent. In other words, all transactions are recorded on each participating Node and continually updated, without exposing PIDI data. The PIDI data is encrypted onto the Blockchain with it’s corresponding generated hash, private and public kets, and decryption key. PIDI data can then be called upon for authorized release to the intended receiver through the BDIMS proprietary official document validation process. This process is composed of four steps in the transfer process of an official government issued digital identity document (see figure 1).

1\. The initial step begins with the validation of the sender’s ledger through a set number of confirmations. Once the sender’s ledger is validated, a one-way encryption request is sent from the sender to the receiver where the receiver’s ledger is validated through a set number of confirmations. 2. The receiver’s ledger receives the request to validate and is approved if keys and hash are valid. Validation is recorded on a new block and confirmation is sent to the sender. 3. The sender receives the validation confirmation. A new one-time use encrypted block will then be created containing the PIDI data and the Decryption Package sent to the receiver. 4. The receiver receives the Decryption Package and the PIDI data on the one-time use block, previously created, is pulled from that block. The decryption package will contain the hash of the block containing the PIDI data (to locate the block), a randomly generated decryption key (to decrypt), and the sender’s private key and public key (signature verification) to be sent as a decryption package through one-way encryption. These three key components of the decryption package, utilized simultaneously, will decrypt the target block containing the PIDI data for a one-time single use transaction. It is then entered into an official template that is a digitally signed PDF document. For example, after an individual’s driver’s license PIDI data is released, it will then fill into an official driver’s license card template that looks just as a driver’s license would only in a digital format, such as a downloadable PDF. A current example is the use of PDFs for official academic degree documentation. Various templates will be stored on individual Nodes and only pulled up when the decryption package is received and identifies which template to use. At that point the decrypted PIDI information will be entered into the template for official document use. In the case of an expired driver’s license, an amendment to the Blockchain must be made to either halt use of the expired document or issue a new driver’s license with updated data to a new encrypted block and set that block’s hash as the new identifier for this individual’s driver’s license request (see figure 1). If the digital identity information for a driver’s license has expired then an amendment must be made to the block that data is stored on to disregard the older expired block and create a new encrypted block containing any updated driver’s license information and a new date of expiry. This expiry date will be monitored autonomously on the Blockchain, meaning that a notice will be sent to the driver’s license holder notifying them of the upcoming expiry. Once the driver’s license holder meets the renewal requirements, then a new driver’s license will be added to the Blockchain and the amendment will now direct driver’s license requests for this individual to the new block rather than the previously expired block. Making amendments to the Blockchain, just as amendments are made to official identity documentation in the real-world, requires the standardization of digitally signed credentials and that is the main underlying factor contributing to why the BDIMS is a disruptive innovation. The BDIMS brings to real-world application the use of DLB technology in a simple-easy-to-use platform for PIDI management. The Key Objectives are to (1) develop an operating prototype BDIMS, and to (2) study it’s implementation in the real-world utilizing the sequential mixed- methods Blockchain Adoption Research Framework (Sindi, 2019). There are multiple questions regrading the feasibility of the service side and the product side. On the service side, the validated Blockchain Adoption Research Framework (Sindi, 2019) assists in Determining the Commercial Feasibility and has been utilized in previous research displaying a demand for a more secure, more autonomous, more sustainable, and contactless BDIMS system (Sindi, 2019).

Results from this proposed study will answer questions, such as: (a) How will the intended user base adopt the BDIMS?, (b) Which factors will inhibit and which factors will facilitate adoption?, (c) Will the population find the BDIMS easy to use?, (d) Will the population share the same subjective beliefs about how digital identity security should be managed and how the BDIMS manages digital identity security? On the product side, in developing a functioning prototype BDIMS, the Software Architecture of the BDIMS combined with the resulting set of code will determine the technical feasibility of the encrypted-decrypted BDIMS. Results from technical analysis and composition of code will answer questions, such as: (a) Is there a possibility of creating an encrypted-decrypted Blockchain?, (b) Will there be an issue of congestion within the encryption and decryption process?, (c) Can decrypted PIDI data fill into it’s corresponding official document template?, (d) Will making amendments to the Blockchain to update, for example, an expired document, create an issue locating the most recent block?, (e) Will decrypted data transfer into a pdf document template for viewing and downloading without security breach access points?, and (d) Will the BDIMS scale for mass use? To shed light on the commercial and technical feasibility of this product, previously conducted research on the developed proof of concept prototype BDIMS, gives insight into the future implementation and commercialization of Distributed Ledger Blockchain technology for PIDI data management. The initial Proof of Concept was built to connect to an existing Blockchain for pseudo PIDI data transmission so to trial the system among a population or potential customer base. Blockchain for Digital Identity Management research shed light on multiple factors that impact adoption, such as a simple use interface design, autonomy to send PIDI data from home at any time, and the alignment of individuals’ beliefs of how their PIDI data should be managed and how DLB technology manages PIDI data (Sindi, 2019). The Technical Milestones to be accomplished to bring the product to market that must be met to develop an operating BDIMS in a real-world use case during phase I are as stated: (1) storage of PIDI data on blocks in an encrypted manner, (2) decryption package to release encrypted PIDI data on newly created one-time use block to the desired receiver, (3) input decrypted PIDI data into an official identification documentation template, and (4) administer amendments to the Blockchain in response to expired documentation and/or incoming renewal documentation or a mandatory hold.
