# Statement of the Problem

More than 9 out of 10 cyber-attacks are targeted at retrieving Personally Identifiable Digital Identity (PIDI) data, such as a social security number or home address. According to the Breach Level Index, 4,861,553 records are stolen every day. Healthcare data breaches are the most costly as cost having risen 42% since 2020 and each breach costing $10.1 million dollars. In addition to the current security risk, current legacy digital identity management systems do not allow for autonomy in sending oneâ€™s official PIDI data contact-free from home. Another issue is digital identity system sustainability. Currently, legacy systems require preventive security measures involving significant resources allocated towards maintenance and updates to continual security threats. Computer hardware is also required, which also involves maintenance. Blockchain technology is overwhelmingly sustainable as PIDI data moves from a centralized to a distributed decentralized peer-to-peer system where the participants act as the storage, transfer, and security mechanisms. This project plans to utilize Blockchain Engineering techniques to develop a Quantum-Resistant Encrypted Blockchain Digital Identity Management System and to also utilize

the Blockchain Adoption Research Framework (Sindi, 2019) to analyze personal subjective beliefs and user interface design facets that impact adoption. This drives the momentum to potentially advance knowledge in Blockchain Adoption Research and in Encrypted Blockchain Engineering to overcome the technical risk of this proposed project.

Additional Solution Drivers:

* 1-1.5 billion lack official identity verification and management
* Refugees tend to discard their official identification forms to prevent deportation
*   Half of women in low income communities lack official identification limiting access to essential

    health and economic services
* Autonomy to send PIDI from home prevents virus transmission
*   Distributed Ledger Blockchain Digital Identity Management is a recently added category
